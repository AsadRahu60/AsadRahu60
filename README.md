## Test Automation Platform Demo

To run the asynchronous demo script that exercises the ecommerce checkout bundle and prints a sample report, execute:

```bash
python demo.py
```

The script initializes the default bundles, executes the ecommerce suite, and outputs a plain-text summary detailing total tests, pass rate, and per-test results alongside a canvas-style ASCII dashboard for quick visual scanning in the terminal.
